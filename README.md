# ghc-decrypt
Bash scripts for decrypting and re-encryping save files from Ghost Hunting Corp.

I wrote these scripts purely for educational purposes and thus did not include the encryption key used by the game in the repo because if you know how to find it you most likely know how to figure out how the game's save files work and could have made your own scripts.
